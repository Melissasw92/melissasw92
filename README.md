I am a dedicated Full-Stack Engineering student at Atlas School, graduating in May 2026, with a passion for front-end development and crafting user-friendly digital experiences. My goal is to work with a local company where I can continue to grow my technical skills and contribute to impactful projects.

Before transitioning into tech, I spent nine years in customer service as a hairstylist, including three years as a general manager. This experience honed my problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and leadership skills—qualities I now bring to my work as a developer.

My technical toolkit includes C, C#, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, LINQ, GitHub, .NET, and VS Code. I’m excited to apply my diverse background and technical expertise to build innovative solutions and collaborate with forward-thinking teams.

Let’s connect—I’m always eager to learn, share ideas, and explore new opportunities in the tech industry.
